# Project1

I am making a Celsius to Farenheit converter.  If I have enough time, I will try to make it convert backwards as well from Farenheit to Celsius.  I might also add a fun picture nearby to practice adding images.

So far, I have it so that the user can input a number into the Textview above "Hello World" and it changes the "Hello World" to the Farenheit of the entered number when the FAB on the bottom right is pressed.
It crashes if no number is entered. I will aim to fix that with a try_catch block.
